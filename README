check_md5 and check_sha512

A Nagios plugin written in Bash to check the MD5 sum of a single file. 
In case the files MD5 change the plugin issues a critical state. This behavior 
can be changed by using a --warning argument, so that only a warning state is 
issued. 

The new check_sha512.sh checks does the exact same thing except it uses sha512sum.
Replace the --md5 flag with --sha512.
